# ENV301 Community Trail Cameras
Hello, and thank you for taking the time to add your trail camera data to this data repository. We are the Environmental Science and Studies majors at Colby-Sawyer College, working on our Third-Year Community-Based Research Project. Our team is utilizing various monitoring methods across five specific conserved and private lands in Merrimack County, located in Wilmot, Sutton, Warner, and New London.

Some of the methods we are employing include trail cameras, ultrasonic bat recorders, and drone imagery. While these tools are valuable, they won't fully capture the diversity of species in these areas. That's why we need your help to gain a better understanding of the wildlife present in your town. The information gathered from this survey will help guide our approach to citizen science regarding forest monitoring.
